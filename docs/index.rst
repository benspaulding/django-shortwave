Django Shortwave
================

Overview
--------

``django-shortwave`` provides the ability for users to create and manage
custom command files for use with Shortwave_.

Using the instructions found in the `default commands file`_, users can add
their own commands to a custom wave file. They can then provide the URL of
their custom commands file to Shortwave_ and save their new bookmarklet.

From that point users can add, delete, and change their custom commands from
the admin and their bookmarklet updates immediately (thatâ€™s the beauty of
Shortwave_).

Really?
-------

Yes, this application really is just a glorified, big-hammer way of creating,
editing, and serving a few text files. Why? The fun. The exercise. The
laziness of not wanting to manage and backup some random text files on a
static server. Wanting non-technical family members to have a syntactically
correct commands file, should they ever want one.

Big answers to small problems can sometimes be fun.
