Thanks for downloading django-shortwave.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.4 or greater and Django 1.0 or
later. (Note that the test settings use the DATABASES setting introduced in
Django 1.2.) Then run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

Note this requires a working Internet connection if you don't already have the
Python utility "setuptools" installed.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "shortwave" directory to
Python's site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python
installation lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.4)
    C:\\PYTHON\site-packages         (Windows)

This second solution does not require a working Internet connection; it
bypasses "setuptools" entirely.
