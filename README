===========================================================
 Shortwave command file management for Django applications
===========================================================

This application provides the ability for users to create and manage
custom command files for use with Shortwave_ in Django_ applications.

Using the instructions found in the `default commands file`_, users can add their own commands to a custom wave file. They can then provide the URL of their custom commands file to Shortwave_ and save their new bookmarklet.

From that point users can add, delete, and change their custom commands from a web interface and their bookmarklet updates immediately (that is the beauty of
Shortwave_).

For installation instructions, see INSTALL in this directory.
